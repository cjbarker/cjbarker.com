Every so often on Twitter and occasionally in person, I come across the inquiry from folks in search of recommendations for women
to follow on Twitter.

Twitter can be a fire hose of noise, but there is some great signal in there too provided from some
fantastic, leading, prominent women in technology.

When I use the word technology I am using this as a blanket term
to cover several domains such as: software engineering, software architecture, computer science R&D, distributed systems, tech
evangelism, conference coordinators, information security (pentesting, vulnerability research, malware, reverse eng., app
sec, etc.), journalist, and tech. entrepreneurs. It is a massive industry with a wealth of opportunities and amazing contributors including, but not limited, to these diverse, talented, experienced, intelligent, and interesting individuals.  Broaden your horizons and learn something new.
