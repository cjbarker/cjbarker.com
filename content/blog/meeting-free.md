Corporate America and many workplaces in general run rampant with a culture of meetings.

Rather than generating busy work it's more important to <strong>focus on your ability to positively affect the _outcome_</strong> of your organization, whatever it may be, <strong>rather than the _output_</strong> of said busy work.  Busy does not necessarily mean you're being productive.

Next time you receive a meeting invite ask yourself these questions to determine the effectiveness and overall value-add of your attendance at the meeting.

**Avoid Unnecessary Meetings - Ask Yourself:**

1. Is this meeting necessary, at all? Can you solve it over slack or a quick hallway conversation?
2. Is this meeting really urgent? Can it wait until next week? Chances are it can.
3. Can I provide value-add to this meeting, or is there a better resource? Politely decline and/or recommend someone else
4. Am I getting pressure to attend meetings that you feel do not have merit? Reach out to your manager for assistance.

Enjoy the productivity.
