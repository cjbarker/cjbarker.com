Throughout one's career progression an individual contributor (IC) will likely consider a pivot into management.  Before jumping in head first there are points of consideration that a given IC should explore deeply and seriously consider prior to delving into a management role.

It’s important to note that one should be able to articulate the details behind their interest in becoming a manager beyond “because I think I’d be good at it”.  Management is a selfless role that requires self awareness, patience, resilience, constant communication, foresight, high emotional intelligence and much more.  Think long and hard while exploring the pros and cons in what the conversion may entail.
