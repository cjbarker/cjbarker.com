First and foremost, CJ is a father.

He is also a technologist, software developer & architect,
and manager, who is enthusiastic about solving business needs at scale across a variety of industries such as
entertainment, security, and consumer product.  Lastly, he's a passionate [drummer and musician](/music) that plays the piano and guitar poorly. He does not enjoy referring to himself in the 3rd person.

I do my best to put my family first while having fun in the workplace and out. Ocassionally, I'll lose faith in humanity
on [Twitter @cjbarkbark](https://twitter.com/cjbarkbark) or attempt to collect my thoughts and write.

If I am not hanging with my family I spend most of free time reading, playing music, skiing poorly, hiking/camping, or smoothering my dog with love.
