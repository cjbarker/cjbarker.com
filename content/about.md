### Who is CJ Barker? ###

<img style="float: right; padding: 8px;" src="/cj_snow.jpg" alt="CJ post ski struggles" />

First and foremost, CJ is a husband and father. 

He is also a technologist, software developer/architect,
and manager who is enthusiastic about the information security domain.  Lastly, he's a passionate [drummer and musician](/music) that plays the piano and guitar poorly. He does not enjoy referring to himself in the 3rd person.

I do my best to put my family first while having fun in the workplace and out.
