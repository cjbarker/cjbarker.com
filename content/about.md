### Who is CJ Barker? ###

<img style="float: right; margin: 8px; border-radius: 8px;"  src="/lego_cj.jpg" alt="Lego (non-action) figure CJ" />
First and foremost, CJ is a husband and father. 

He is also a technologist, software developer/architect,
and manager who is enthusiastic about the information security domain.  Lastly, he's a passionate [drummer and musician](/music) that plays the piano and guitar poorly. He does not enjoy referring to himself in the 3rd person.

I do my best to put my family first while having fun in the workplace and out. Ocassionally, I'll lose faith in humanity
on [Twitter @cjbarkbark](https://twitter.com/cjbarkbark) or attempt to collect my thoughts and write.

If I am not hanging with my family I spend most of free time reading, playing music, skiing poorly, hiking/camping, or smoothering my dogs with love while the cat continues to ignore me.
