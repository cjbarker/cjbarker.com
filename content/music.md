As a drummer, I have been fortunate enough to play and collaborate with some amazing musicians. Whether it's tracking an album, filling in for a session, or eating baloney on hand while on tour - I have been through a couple rodeos.

I've toured regionally and nationally, licensed music to ABC, CNBC & MTV, played [SXSW Showcase](https://www.sxsw.com/festivals/music/) 3x, performed live with Robert Pollard of [Guided By Voices](https://www.guidedbyvoices.com/), and covered a wide gamut of styles: rock, punk, pop, classical, folk & country.  Hell, I even recorded drums on the Beatles white album for a bachelor party.

I have a wide variety of percussion and drum gear to meet the soundscape for what the music is looking/calls for. I aim to play for the song and band first while focusing on having fun and leaning into it.  Influences vary widely for me as does what I'm currently listening to.  I am comfortable playing with a click, providing backing vocals, and playing sampler ([Roland SPD-S](http://www.roland.ca/products/spd-s/) &amp; [Octapad](https://eg.roland.com/products/octapad_spd-30/)).

Below you can find tracks from a few artists that I've had the pleasure of collaborating and contributing with. If you'd like to hear more check out my [SoundCloud.](https://soundcloud.com/cjbarkbark)
